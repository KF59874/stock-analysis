##1. Overview of Project

###Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze the stock data from years 2017 and 2018. The project was initiated by client "Steve" who initially asked for a data analysis on the DQ stocks only. However, seeing as there was also data regarding other stocks, the template was used to refactor the analysis to include more stocks. 

The data was refactored to make the code of the initial analysis more efficient. The ultimate goal was to have the code run quicker. Hence, the timer was included in this analysis.
